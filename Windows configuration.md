# Install and configure VIM on windows

There are 2 options to install VIM on windows
  1. Install MS-Dos Vim (vim for windows). It is very different with how to do it on Linux or Unix. Fonts and Style do not seem nice
  2. Install Bash (ubuntu) on windows then configure setups as in Linux or Unix. This is better and seems to be easier.
